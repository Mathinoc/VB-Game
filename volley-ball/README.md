# Volley-Ball game

The Volley-Ball game is a match between two teams and takes two inputs - the probability that each team wins the point when they serve.
When pressing "start", the program will print the evolution of the game based on the given probabilities.
The only requirement (like all games) is that both probabilities cannot equal 1.

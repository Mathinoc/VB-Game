# Colored Squares

Colored Squares allows you to click on four buttons and save the color of the buttons you clicked on in the center of the page. Each button color can be changed at your convenience either by using a color picker or by typing the color (for example "#D91E9B" or "rgb(217,30,155)").
On page refresh, the saved colors remain visible and your buttons still have the color you picked (if you did so!). A bar slider enables you to change the number of colored re displayed among the last ones you clicked.


 allows you to add photos (from http://flickr.com) and videos (from http://vimeo.com) as favorites. After adding a bookmark, you can see some basic information like the title, the creation date, the author, etc. The bookmarks can be rearranged via dragging and dropping or deleted. When clicking on the title or the thumbnail of a bookmark, a pop-up window will appear to play the video or display the image.

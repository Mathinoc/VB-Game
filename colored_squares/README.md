# Colored Squares

Colored Squares has 3 features
1. Four colors can be chosen. These are represented as the four square buttons in the corners of the page. The color of each button can be changed using the color picker or with a hex code at the top of the page. 
2. The color of the center rectangles is controlled by the colored buttons. When clicking on a colored button a new rectangle of the same color appears. If the maximum number of center rectangles has been reached, clicking on a button changes the color of the final rectangle. The previous colored rectangles are preserved. 
3. The number of center rectangles is controlled by a slider. The minimum number of center rectangles is 10 and maximum is 40.
